&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would personally really enjoy an overall shift to remotely-working offices. It especially makes sense for a software-development environment, where everything is readily portable. Developers could find it far more convenient to have the choice to remain home or even use their own personalized setups. Overall, a transition to working from home could be a massive boon to software developers.
